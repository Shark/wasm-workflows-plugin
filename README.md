## About The Project

This is a tool that allows you run WebAssembly modules instead of containers for your steps in [Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/). You might rightfully ask yourself what problem this solves for you.

The two most important aspects are security and performance:

* :lock: **Security**

  The [list of things to do](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Docker_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html) when you want to run containers securely is long and the topic is more complex than even ambitious users care about. Containers are [vulnerable in many ways](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8693491) because of their denylist approach to security: they're allowed to do many things by default.

  WebAssembly's security model is the opposite. As with smartphone apps, they must be given permission for potentially infringing tasks. For example, you might want to give a module the permission to read and write files but not communicate over the internet.

  Container images from third parties you don't know are usually a security nightmare. With WebAssembly, you can run code you don't fully trust with more confidence. Say you have a workflow step that renders Markdown. When the author of your Markdown parser container image decides to deliver a crypto miner instead, most Kubernetes setups will happily run it. If you were using this project and a WebAssembly module: zero chance, since it's easy for you to know that the step doesn't need the network but only takes an input parameter and produces some output. [This example is not made up](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/fr/security/news/virtualization-and-cloud/malicious-docker-hub-container-images-cryptocurrency-mining).

  <details>
    <summary>More about the difference between containers and Wasm modules</summary>
    <img src="doc/container-vs-wasm.png" style="max-width: 700px">
    <p>Linux processes use more than 300 system calls for any task that involves sharing data with outside of a process. Containers are a combination of different Linux Kernel technologies (namespaces, cgroups etc.) that segment one computer into many seemlingly independent containers. But this very much depends on a) the secure implementation of all syscalls not to leak anything and b) trust in the application inside the container to do what the user intends it to.</p>
    <p>Wasm modules are very restricted by default. We use application-level capabilities to allow them to access external resources like the network, S3 object stores, or the filesystem. The modules are the capability consumers, the Wasm runtime is the capability provider. The capability provider translates the requests from the Wasm module and acts as a secure proxy to the outside.</p>
  </details>

* :runner: **Performance**

  Containers have some overhead: for each workflow step, Argo creates new Kubernetes Pod. This Pod has several containers to enable all the Argo features, your code is just one of them. All the containers must execute, then results are gathered and sent back to Argo. This all takes time: container images are often towards 100s of megabytes, they may rely on interpreted languages like Python or have huge dependencies leading to a slow start time. You may know the [Cold Start issue](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/operating-lambda-performance-optimization-part-1/) with Function-as-a-Service. In Argo, every workflow step is a cold start.

  Because WebAssembly modules don't have to bring a whole operating system, they're much smaller. And there is less setup work to do, even for interpreted languages. This means that a module can be run in a matter of milliseconds rather than tens of seconds.

WebAssembly is a new technology in the browser and even more so in the Cloud-Native ecosystem. But there are several ways to ease the transition:

* Containers and Wasm modules play together just fine in the same workflow. Existing container setups don't have to be migrated just because they could. Use Wasm for the tasks for which is a good fit and leave the rest to containers.

* You can find ready-to-use templates for popular programming languages in the [`wasm-modules/templates/`](wasm-modules/templates/) folder.

* We will provide pre-made modules for popular use cases such as image and text processing, API connectors, etc.

### Built with

Open Source software stands on the shoulders of giants. It wouldn't have been possible to build this tool with very little extra work without the authors of these lovely projects below.

* [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) is used to implement the Argo Executor Plugin API, pull and execute Wasm modules
* [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) is the Rust web framework to handle RPC calls
* [Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime) is the WebAssembly Virtual Machine ([WASI](https://wasi.dev) is [supported](https://crates.io/crates/wasmtime-wasi), too)
* [wit-bindgen](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen) provides the interface between this project as the Wasm host and the Wasm modules
* [oci-distribution](https://crates.io/crates/oci-distribution) allows the tool to pull Wasm modules from OCI registries
* [Best README Template](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* This guide assumes you have a working Argo Workflows installation with v3.3.0 or newer.
* You will need to install the [Argo CLI](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/cli/) with v3.3.0 or newer.
* `kubectl` must be available and configured to access the Kubernetes cluster where Argo Workflows is installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and change to the [`argo-plugin/`](argo-plugin/) directory:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Shark/wasm-workflows-plugin
   cd wasm-workflows-plugin/argo-plugin
   ```

1. Build the plugin ConfigMap:

   ```shell
   argo executor-plugin build .
   ```

1. Register the plugin with Argo in your cluster:

   Ensure to specify `--namespace` if you didn't install Argo in the default namespace.

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f wasm-executor-plugin-configmap.yaml
   ```

## Usage

Now that the plugin is registered in Argo, you can run workflow steps as Wasm modules by simply calling the `wasm` plugin:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  generateName: wasm-
spec:
  entrypoint: wasm
  arguments:
    parameters:
      - name: text
        value: Hello World from WebAssembly
  templates:
    - name: wasm
      inputs:
        parameters:
          - name: text
      plugin:
        wasm:
          module:
            oci: ghcr.io/shark/wasm-workflows-plugin-example-ferris-says:latest
```

The `wasm` template will produce an output parameter `text` with an awesome message:

```
 ___________________
/ "Hello World from \
\ WebAssembly"      /
 -------------------
        \
         \
            _~^~^~_
        \) /  o o  \ (/
          '_   -   _'
          / '-----' \
```

Input and output parameters between workflow steps work just like you'd expect. Other features like artifacts may still be on the [roadmap](#roadmap) though, which is advised to check for your use case.

### Module Development

Creating a new Wasm module is easy and works with every language.

There are ready-to-use templates for:

* [AssemblyScript](wasm-modules/templates/assemblyscript/)
* [Rust](wasm-modules/templates/rust/)
* [TinyGo](wasm-modules/templates/tinygo/)

You implement a [WASI](https://wasi.dev) module. WASI is a modular system interface for Wasm. The principle is easy: the module is given its input in a file at `/work/input.json`. It is expected to write its results to a file at `/work/result.json` and exit.

We created an easy-to-use wrapper for Rust. The wrapper abstracts all the file handling magic and lets you implement a function with a signature like this:

```rust
fn run(invocation: PluginInvocation) -> anyhow::Result<PluginResult> {
    // This is where your code goes

    PluginResult {
        phase: Phase::Succeeded,
        message: "Done".to_string(),
        outputs: Default::default(),
    }
}
```

For any other language you can easily parse the JSON yourself:

* PluginInvocation: [Example](crates/workflow-model/doc/plugin-invocation.example.json), [Schema](crates/workflow-model/doc/plugin-invocation.schema.json)
* PluginResult: [Example](crates/workflow-model/doc/plugin-result.example.json), [Schema](crates/workflow-model/doc/plugin-result.schema.json)

### Capabilities

Capabilities expand what modules can do. Out of the box, modules can take input parameters and artifacts and produce some output. Take a look at the [capabilities for wasmCloud](https://wasmcloud.dev/reference/host-runtime/capabilities/) for a more complete list of useful capabilities. The capabilities that this plugin offers will be extended in the future.

#### HTTP Capability

The HTTP capability provider allows you to make HTTP requests from your Wasm module. The capability is available in every module mode. Please refer to the [`wasi-experimental-http`](https://github.com/deislabs/wasi-experimental-http) repository for complete information of how to access the HTTP capability from your module. There you will find examples for both Rust and AssemblyScript.

When using the HTTP capability, you need to whitelist the hosts that the module is allowed to connect to. This illustrates the ease-of-use that WebAssembly's capability-oriented security model offers: for you, it's very easy to tell if a module should be able to connect outside â€“ and now securing your code got easy.

You can find a full-featured module at [`wasm-modules/contrib/http-request`](wasm-modules/contrib/http-request/).

The module supports the following input parameters:

* `url`: the URL that you want to call
* `method`: HTTP request method (e.g. `GET`, `POST`, etc.) â€“ optional, defaults to `GET`
* `body`: HTTP request body as a string â€“ optional
* `content_type`: HTTP request body content type (e.g. `application/json`) â€“ optional

As a result, you get the following output parameters:

* `status_code`: HTTP response status code as a number (e.g. `200`)
* `body`: HTTP response body as a string
* `content_type`: HTTP response body content type (e.g. `text/plain`)

The `http-request` module can be used in a workflow like so:

```yaml
- name: wasm
  inputs:
    parameters:
    - name: url
      value: https://httpbin.org/post
    - name: method
      value: POST
    - name: body
      value: Hello World
    - name: content_type
      value: text/plain
  plugin:
    wasm:
      module:
        oci: ghcr.io/shark/wasm-workflows-plugin-http-request:latest
      permissions:
        http:
          allowed_hosts:
          - https://httpbin.org
```

### Distributed Mode

This plugin has two modes:

* A `local` Mode.

  This is the default. It will run Wasm modules in the plugin process. This is a single container per workflow instance. This is fine for most use cases that don't need infinite scaling within a workflow. It's also very easy to use because there is nothing to configure: it just works.

* A `distributed` Mode.

  This mode is more advanced because it will orchestrate Wasm module invocations in a Kubernetes cluster. Much like Argo itself creates a Pod for each workflow task, the distributed mode will create Pods for Wasm modules.

  What makes this possible is [Krustlet](https://docs.krustlet.dev). Krustlet shows up as a new node in your Kubernetes cluster, and it will execute Wasm modules that Kubernetes schedules to this node. I [forked Krustlet](https://github.com/Shark/krustlet) since there are some changes necessary to make Krustlet aware of the particularities of running workflow tasks as Wasm modules (inputs, outputs, parameters, artifacts, etc.).

  For the distributed mode, you need to do a bit more:

  * Create a service account and proper credentials for this plugin. See [`argo-plugin/rbac.yaml`](argo-plugin/rbac.yaml) for details.
  * Inject the service account credentials into the plugin container. For this, there is a special [`plugin-distributed.yaml`](argo-plugin/plugin-distributed.yaml) showing you how.

  By default, the plugin will be registered to the `wasm_distributed` key. This allows you to run the plugin in both modes simultaneously.

### :construction: Module Source

There is not a single idea of how Wasm modules can be distributed. There are a lot of practical options because of their comparably small size. In Cloud-Native, OCI/Docker registries are a natural fit since they're required anyway for container images. Other viable options include the [WebAssembly package manager WAPM](https://wapm.io) that already serves WASI-compatible Wasm modules. Moreover, the [Bindle](https://github.com/deislabs/bindle) project is another alternative that provides a modern infrastructure for distributing applications as a bunch of independent bundles with well-defined relationships between each of them.

Currently, this project only supports OCI registries and the format created by the [`wasm-to-oci`](https://github.com/engineerd/wasm-to-oci) tool (see [roadmap](#roadmap)). Other module sources can be represented in the invocation format without issue however:

```yaml
- name: wasm
  plugin:
    wasm:
      module:
        # you would use one of these options
        oci: ghcr.io/someone/somemodule:latest    # already supported
        wapm: syrusakbary/qr2text@0.0.1           # on the roadmap
        bindle: example.com/stuff/mybindle/v1.2.3 # on the roadmap
```

## Roadmap

- [x] **Distributed Mode**
- [x] Create ready-to-use modules for demo (cowsay), and then image/text processing
- [x] Support input + output artifacts
- [ ] Enable additional capability providers (~~HTTP~~, S3, SQL, etc.)
- [ ] Support authentication for OCI (pull secrets)
- [ ] Support [WAPM](https://wapm.io) as a module source
- [ ] Support [Bindle]() as a module source
- [ ] Implement CLI to invoke modules locally (greatly improves developer experience)
